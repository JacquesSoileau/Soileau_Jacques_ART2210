I chose to do my project based on Paul Gauguin. I like his simplistic style with the dark outlines. He has very little backgrounds and it is all a dark mood. His choice of colors is what attracted me to do my self portrait this way. He has a nice style and tone and it just grabbed my attention very well. I felt like this could make my self portrait drawing feel the same way.
