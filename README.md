I chose to do my project based on Paul Gauguin. I like his simplistic style with the dark outlines. He has very little backgrounds and it is all a dark mood. His choice of colors is what attracted me to do my self portrait this way. He has a nice style and tone and it just grabbed my attention very well. I felt like this could make my self portrait drawing feel the same way. I love the way he drew it simple but it still gets the point across that it is a self portrait. I also love the way that there are a good amount of deatils that are not being ruined by how simple this portrait is. This is why i chose to do my self portrait the same way that Paul Gauguin did.
